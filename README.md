[Python Programming Tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/)

[YouTube: How did Python become a data science powerhouse?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9by46AAqz70&t=34s)

### MatplotLib
Deep Learning is far from being an exact science and a lot of what you do is based on getting a feel for the underlying mechanics, visualising the moving parts makes it easier to understand and Matplotlib is the go-to library for visualisation

[Matplotlib official](http://matplotlib.org)

[Matplotlib tutorial](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

### NumPy
NumPy is a fast optimized package for scientific computing, and is also the underlying library a lot of Machine Learning frameworks are build on top of. Becoming a NumPy ninja is an important step to mastery.

### Pandas
Pandas is a high level data manipulation tool based on the Numpy package. At it's core Pandas uses a DataFrame which allows you to store and manipulate tabular data.

[Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)


### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow is designed and highly optimised to take
advantage of GPU technology in a distributed manner not only on a single instance with many GPU's, but also across many devices and networks, making 
it an ideal framework for learning and production.
